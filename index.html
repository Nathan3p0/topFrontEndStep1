    <h1>Learning GIT and Front End</h1>
    <img src="images/github.png" alt="What we learn with joy, we never forget.">
    <p>I am currently in the process of going through <a href="http://www.theodinproject.com">The Odin Project</a> course curriculum. With a background in Graphic Design I am working to expand my skillset into Web Development. While using this time to learn the bare basics of

      <ul>
        <li>HTML</li>
        <li>CSS</li>
        <li>and Javascript</li>
      </ul>

      I will also be using git. As I go through the steps on this little webpage there will be a new commit for each added feature. Such as an added Stylesheet or Javascript function. While a basic task, it will help to reinforce my knowledge of all the resources. </p>
